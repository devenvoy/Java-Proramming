    Thread - A thread of execution in a program (kind of like a virtual cpu)
    the jvm allows an application to have multiple threads running concurrently
    Each thread can execute parts of your code in parallel with main thread
    Each thread has a priority

    priority
            The Java Virtual Machine continues to execute threads until either of the following occurs
    					1. The exit method of class Runtime has been called
    					2. All user threads have died

    				When a JVM starts up, there is a thread which calls the main method
    				This thread is called â€œmain"

    Daemon thread is a low priority thread that runs in background to perform tasks such as garbage collection
    JVM terminates itself when all user threads (non-daemon threads) finish their execution
